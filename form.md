QUESTIONNAIRE:

Please fill out the questionnaire strictly according to the provided form.
This is important for correctly integrating your data into the community resource database.

🩵 Skills and Knowledge (как вы думаете стоит ли прислать здесь сначала список категорий, чтобы человек выбрал свою экспертизу, а уже потом показывать ему разделы определенной категории? можно ли после выбора разделов одной категории показать пункт "Добавить еще одну экспертизу" и вновь показать список для тех, кто обладает несколькими экспертизами?)


Please provide information about the skills, knowledge, and professional abilities you are willing to share with the community — whether it’s yoga teaching, photography, design, coding, business strategy, breathwork, writing, marketing, sound healing, or anything else you’ve mastered. Everything that expands someone’s clarity, growth, or JOY counts.

Each of us carries unique mastery: something we do naturally, deeply, and with love. Here you can list the areas where you can:
• give a thoughtful consultation,
• teach your skill or method,
• guide someone through a process,
• create or deliver a clear final result,
• or complete a project fully “turnkey.”

Please share only the skills in which you feel confident and capable of supporting others on a real, professional level. This keeps our ecosystem strong, safe, and full of genuine value.

🩵 Personal Introductions to Key 
People

In almost every life story, there is a moment when someone opened a door for us.
A mentor who believed in us early.
A friend who introduced us to a circle where everything suddenly made sense.
A person who took us by the hand — and led us into a community, an opportunity, or a world that changed everything.

This section is your chance to become that person for someone else.

Here, you can describe the key people in your orbit — founders, creators, innovators, curators, thinkers, leaders, or quiet powerhouses whom you are willing to introduce to other community members.

Sharing information about them does not commit you to making an introduction. It simply expresses your openness to being a bridge when the timing and energy feel right.

Any exchange of contacts or arrangement of a personal introduction will happen only after all necessary details have been mutually agreed upon.
A community resident always has the right to decline an introduction at any time, without explanation.

🩵 Real Estate

Whether it’s an apartment, a villa you use only part-time — or simply your space is spacious enough to host another resident in a separate room — this is where you can share it with the community. Every home carries its own atmosphere and energy, and even the smallest space can become a place of inspiration, rest, or creativity for someone else.

By offering access to your real estate, you’re sharing more than walls and a roof. You’re giving another resident the chance to reset their mind, dive into a project, or simply enjoy a refreshing change of scenery. Spaces shape our inner states — and sometimes a new environment is exactly what someone needs.

You stay fully in control: you decide when, how, and under what conditions your place can be used. Listing your property doesn’t obligate you to anything; it simply opens the possibility for meaningful, supportive exchanges within the community.

Please list only the properties you are willing to share free of charge. JOYSEEKERS is not a place for earning money — it’s a space for mutual growth, generosity, and empowerment through support.

Please provide information about the cars you are willing to make available to community residents. Describe the key specifications, usage conditions, and any limitations to ensure proper coordination of availability.

By sharing your car, you’re offering more than just a vehicle — you’re giving someone the chance to experience freedom, explore, and create new memories. Even a simple ride can bring joy, inspiration, and moments that stay with people.

Listing your car does not obligate you to anything: before providing the vehicle, you will confirm all details with the specific resident, and you reserve the right to decline the request at any time without giving a reason. You remain fully in control of who, when, and how your car is used.

We care about your experience of sharing resources within the community. Our goal is to ensure that every interaction is comfortable, respectful, and aligned with your personal boundaries.

By providing clear details about the resources you’re open to sharing, you help the community grow stronger, build meaningful connections, and make it easier for us to match your tools and skills with those who truly need them.

Please provide information about the vessels you are willing to make available to community residents — whether it’s a sailing yacht, a speedboat, a jetski, or even a catamaran. Everything that brings JOY counts.

We don’t measure value in feet, engines, or length. We don’t compare whose boat is bigger or faster. What we share here is not “status” — but experiences, freedom and the joy of being on the water together. Even the smallest boat can create the biggest memories.

Every sharing request is fully within your control — you decide when, how, and with whom the adventure happens. Listing your vessel does not obligate you to anything; you simply give the community a chance to dream with you.

🩵 Specialists

Each of us has our own “super-people” — specialists who once saved the day, guided us through a challenge, brought clarity, or simply made life easier. A lawyer who solves things with one email. A doctor you trust without hesitation. A mentor who asks one question — and everything suddenly makes sense.

We often forget how valuable these contacts are. But within a community, each of these specialists becomes more than just a number in your phone. They are a source of relief, support, clarity, and solutions. By sharing someone you personally trust, you help others save time, energy, and peace of mind — and you expand a space where any question can find its expert.

Please list only those specialists you have personally worked with and can genuinely vouch for.
